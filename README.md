## Overcast Upload Shortcut

This is an iOS Shortcut for uploading files to [Overcast](https://overcast.fm).

The shortcut supports launching directly from the Shortcuts app if you want to choose one
or more files from iCloud Drive. You can also use the shortcut in a share sheet to upload
audio files from other iOS apps (like Safari). If you upload one file, the shortcut will
allow you to rename the file during the upload. If you're uploading multiple files, it
will just send them all in sequence.
