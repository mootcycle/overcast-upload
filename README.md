## Overcast Upload Shortcut

This is an iOS Shortcut for uploading files to [Overcast](https://overcast.fm).

The shortcut supports:
* Running the shortcut directly to launch the iCloud drive file picker for audio files (single or multiple selection).
* Running as a share sheet target for an audio file in an app.
* Running as a share sheet target for a YouTube video. The video will be downloaded and converted to audio inside the shortcut.
* Renaming any single share item in-flight.

[Current version of the shortcut on iCloud.](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/49b978f815dc4258b9a0ba3c33a4e92f)

Thanks to the [automators.fm](https://talk.automators.fm/t/youtube-audio-to-overcast/2175) forum for the YouTube audio conversion.

I've also included a shell script which uses the same logic for local file uploads.
